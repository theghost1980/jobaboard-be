Hive Blockchain Project!
# jobaboard-backend

You can see the live backend running on Heroku. [Visit](https://backendjab.herokuapp.com/)
The backend handles a mongo database, using JWT validation. Also in order to log in or create a new account you must own a HIVE account. 
This backend is made on nodejs and uses a Witness Custom Node in order to connect, sign and interact with the HIVE blockchain.

# More information, do you want to buy this project?

The person who hired me is a well known member of the HIVE network. The main idea was to test me while doing this platform and release it live. For some reasons I do not know, he decided to put the project in standby. This is why if you want to partner up with me to release a live version or even buy it, i am open to discuss and negotiate.
